For BloodPressure, I created 500 bootstrap samples of size 150 each. For every sample, I calculated the mean, standard deviation, and 98th percentile. The average bootstrap results were very close to the population values, especially for the mean and standard deviation. The 98th percentile showed more variation but was still reasonably close. The histograms show that the bootstrap distributions are centered near the population statistics, meaning the bootstrap method works well for estimating these values.
